#Command-line graphics
**Command-line graphics** is a header file which simplifies and gives you access to some Windows console functions.

It can be used to colorize Windows console and text, to draw simple rectangles etc.
It's my old project, so it's a complete mess and spaghetti code, but I think it's usefull.


##How to use?
